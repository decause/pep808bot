 1. Follow the instructions in the README

 2. Be sure to use that chrome plugin to get the hashes of the values you will
    need for the bot

 3. The bot is coded to join the The Trap Train Room
    (http://turntable.fm/the_trap_train_ttt), which is some wild shit if you
    have not had a listen. The chrome plugin will give you the hash of whatever
    room you are in, and then you just add that to the .ini

 4. Once everything is settled, you can run the bot by:
    $ lazysusan -p lazysusan/plugins

 5. Have fun!
